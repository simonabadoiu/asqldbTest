### ASQLDB

This project tests asqldb's jdbc driver using multidimensional arrays. Before making any multidimensional query for asqldb, you must install Rasdaman. On the [Rasdaman installation page](http://www.rasdaman.org/wiki/Install) you can find all the details for a correct and complete installation.

Now that you have installed Rasdaman, you can clone this project and import it into you favorite IDE as a Maven project. In order to have all the dependencies for your project, you need to install into your local maven repository rasj.jar and asqldb.jar.

Runnin HibernateMArrayQueryTest will test all the queries from testrun/hibernate. Currently, if everything is correctly installed, 22 tests will fail from a total of 104.

Please check the [ASQLDB project](https://github.com/misev/asqldb) for more info about it, especially if setting up for the first time.
